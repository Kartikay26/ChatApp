ChatApp
=========

A very basic project with Flsk-SocketIO to see how
websockets work and to create a simple chatroom app.

To install, clone the project, navigate to the project 
directory and then:

```sh
$ git clone https://www.github.com/Kartikay26/ChatApp.git
$ cd ChatApp
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python main.py
```

Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 and voila! The
chat app should be running.
